###bit wise operators
print("Print True if the condition is right or print false if the condition is not right: ", 2>3)

## bit wise operations using variables

a = 2 #single equal is using to assigned value and double equals are uses to compare the values with each other
b = 5
c = 7
#for next line we use \n
print("\nPrint True if the condition is right or print false if the condition is not right: ", a>b<c)
print("\nPrint True if the condition is right or print false if the condition is not right: ", a<b<c)
print("\nPrint True if the condition is right or print false if the condition is not right: ", a>b>c)

##Here it looking for if a<b or a==b means any one condition between them will satidfied than return True and here it using or operators of logical gates
print("\nPrint True if the condition is right or print false if the condition is not right: ", a<=b<=c)

print("\nPrint True if the condition is right or print false if the condition is not right: ", a!=b<=c)

print("\nPrint True if the condition is right or print false if the condition is not right: ", a!=b=
